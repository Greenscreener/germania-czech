# Germania Czech
This is a fork of the Germania One font by John Vargas Beltran with added Czech
characters by lazily gluing different glyphs together in FontForge. This font is
available under the OFL licence. If you find some inaccuracies either in the
font or in some licence stuff, please don't hesitate to contact me or drop an
issue or a pull request.
